Analyse whether XX company, a British electrical retailer,  should launch their app or not


## Methdology (Extracted from our report)
We employed two analysis: 
1. competitor analysis
2. company’s social media analysis

Competitor analysis seeks to understand the performance of the competitor’s mobile application and to figure out what customers expect from the application. In competitor analysis, we analyzed the mobile applications of Amazon and Argos to find out the merits and drawbacks of the applications. We selected these because those applications have been in existence for over five years and as such, we believe we can draw some insights into their customers’ experiences of using their mobile applications.

We performed company’s social media analysis by studying customer behavior on XX company's website. We went a step further to scrape data from their customer service social media pages; Facebook and Twitter in order to understand how the company performs so far from the customers’ point of view.

The analysis occurs in four steps:
1. review retrieval
2. text-preprocessing
3. sentiment analysis of reviews
4. topic extraction.
